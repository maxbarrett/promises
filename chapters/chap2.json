	"html": "To unit test this bit of code, we’d either need to actually have a server running, or monkey patch XMLHttpRequest to return mock data. Having to run the server will make tests very slow, it’s a pain to set up, and it usually introduces flakiness into tests. The monkey patching route solves the speed and flakiness problems, but it means you have to remember to un-patch any patched objects between tests, and it brings additional complexity and brittleness by forcing you to specify the exact on-the-wire format for your data (and in having to update the tests whenever this format changes)."
