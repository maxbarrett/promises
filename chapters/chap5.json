Angular does this checking by making a copy of all watched properties and comparing them to the current value to see if they’ve changed. In fact, Angular may run this up to ten times to ensure full propagation. If changes are still occurring after ten iterations, Angular exits with an error. If that occurs, you probably have a dependency loop that you’ll need to fix. Though you currently need to worry about this, by the time you’ve finished this book it may be a non-issue. While Angular has had to implement data binding in JavaScript, we’ve been working with the TC39 folks on a low-level native implementation called Object.observe(). With this in place, Angular will automatically use Object.ob serve() wherever present to give you native-speed data binding."
